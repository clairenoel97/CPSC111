1 Iteration
(Chapters 7, 8, 9 in zyBooks; Chapters 4 and 8 in How to Think Like a Computer Scientist)

Define what is repetition in programs
Allows for a group of operations to be performed multiple times
Define what is one iteration
Discuss how loops are defined based on iterations
When is a loop needed?
Apply and implement the 2 looping constructs supported in Python
while
Explicit progress towards the Boolean condition becoming false
for
Iterating over sequences
range()
When is one looping construct more appropriate than the other?
Identify, apply, and implement the major loop patterns
Looping until a general Boolean condition is met
i.e. while bank_balance > 0:
Looping for a certain number of repetitions, which is known before loop execution
i.e. while count < 10:
Looping until a special value is encountered
i.e. a menu
i.e. while choice != "q":
Looping until a value within valid range is entered by user
i.e. while is_valid == False:
Apply and implement nested loops
break statement
What is an infinite loop?
A loop which will execute "forever"
Describe and apply compound (shorthand) assignment operators
These include: +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=
Provide an example of an off-by-one loop error
2 File I/O
(Chapter 10 in zyBooks; Chapter 11 in How to Think Like a Computer Scientist)

What is a file object?

What is the 3-step file processing template?
Open a file
Process the file
Close the file
What is a file mode?
What is a path?
Relative path vs absolute path
Apply open(), close(), readline(), readlines(), print(file=<file object>)and write()

others?
Other topics
Random number generation
Import the random module
Apply the random.randrange() function

Recommended Strategy for Preparing for the Exam
The exam questions will require you to solve problems in a variety of formats: defining key terms, evaluating expressions, writing code, determining the output of code, etc.

I recommend that you use the following activities and materials to prepare for the exam:

Review micro assignments, lab exercises, programming assignments, and problems solved in class
These may well be your best resources. An excellent learning activity would be to re-solve the micro assignments, lab exercises, in class exercises, and programming assignments.
Lesson notes and example code
Read the textbook
Read or re-read zyBooks chapters 7-10 and How to Think Like a Computer Scientist chapters 4, 8, 9, and 11.
Extra Practice Problems
1
The following questions refer to the following program segment:

In [ ]:
g = 0
s = 0
i = 50
t = 0
while i > 0:
    t = int(input())
    s = s + t
    if t < 0:
        g = g + 1
    i -= 1
How many times is the loop body of the while statement executed?
At the end of the execution of the loop, describe the value stored in variable s
At the end of the execution of the loop, describe the value stored in variable g
Modify the above code in order to make the code more readable and indicative of its purpose.

Write a program that uses a loop to print out every other letter in the upper case alphabet.

Write a program to do the following:

Open an input file sentence.txt for reading
Open an output file sentence_out.txt for writing
Read each line in from the input file and write the following to the output file:
Print the contents of the line followed by a comma
Print the length of the line followed by a newline
Example sentence_out.txt

Write a program to prompt the user to enter an integer that is even (for this problem, 0 is neither even nor odd). The code must ensure that en even number is entered. Once an even integer is entered, the program prints the integer to the screen.

5
Write a for loop that sums the squares of the odd integers from -111 to 333 inclusive.

6
The following questions refer to the following code: course = "CptS 111 Spring 2017"

Write code to print the "2" in course
Write code to print the "111" in course using the slice operator
Write code to assign a new variable, new_course, course, but with "Summer" instead of "Spring"
Write code to overwrite the string stored in course in all lower case letters
Write code to assign a new variable, new_string, course, but with the "111" replaced with "121". Use the replace() method to do this.
Write code to print the index of the "2". Use the find() method to do this.

Rewrite the following code segment as an equivalent segment that uses a for loop.

Once a valid input choice is entered, display “Here are the rules” if 1 is chosen. If 2 is chosen display "Starting the game".

Welcome to my game!

    print("")

The following problem is adapted from problem 5.9 in Hanly and Koffman.

Suppose you own a soda distribution that sells Pepsi (ID# 1), Dr. Pepper (ID# 2), Mountain Dew (ID# 3), and Crush (ID# 4) by the case.

Write a program to:

Read the case inventory from a file inventory.txt. In this file there are 4 numbers, one on each line, representing the number of cases for each soda in order of ID#.
Display and implement the functionality for the following menu:
Display current inventory
Purchase cases
Sell cases
Exit
Validate user input (i.e. there are enough cases in the inventory to sell and the menu choice is valid)
MA17
On a blank sheet of paper, write the following:

Your full name
Your TA name
MA #17
Individually (or in pairs), solve the above exam review problems that we didn't solve in class. Each correctly solved problem is worth 1 point. Each student needs to turn in their own solutions to get credit for MA17.

To study for the exam, I recommend solving each problem on paper, then typing up your code and running it. You can check your work this way. Re-write your final, correct solutions in a neat manner to turn in for credit on MA17.
