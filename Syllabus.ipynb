    "### Description\n",
    "This course introduces the algorithmic constructs used to solve a wide range of problems. An important component of this is developing an understanding of the ways in which information is stored in a computer, both in terms of fundamental units of information such as an integer and in terms of larger collections of information contained with a data structure such as a list. Along the way you will implement computer code to solve several meaningful problems that involve areas such as encryption and graphics. It is assumed you have no prior programming experience. This course use the Python programming language.\n",

    "## Course Grading\n",
    "This is an *active learning class*. You are expected to actively attend and participate in lectures and laboratories regularly, and to participate regularly in the Piazza discussions. Active articipation may positively affect your grade at the end of the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Weights\n",
    "* Micro assignments (10%)\n",
    "* Programming assignments (30%)\n",
    "* Labs (20%)\n",
    "* Two midterm exams (20%, 10% each)\n",
    "* One final exam (10%)\n",
    "* zyBooks participation activities (5%)\n",
    "* zyBooks challenge activities (5%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Categories\n",
    "#### Micro Assignments\n",
    "Micro assignments (MAs) ensure that you are attending lecture, staying on top of the textbook reading assignments, and understanding the material. MAs may be graded for participation and/or correctness. MAs can take on the following forms:\n",
    "1. Short assignments completed in lecture.\n",
    "    * *Nearly every lecture will have an MA.* You can think of in-class MAs as a form of lecture attendance.\n",
    "1. Short assignments completed outside of lecture/lab.\n",
    "    * CptS 111 is a UCORE course so there will be writing (non-programming) MAs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **I will drop your 4 lowest MA scores**. This means that you are given 4 MA \"freebies\" that excuse your failure to turn in a MA *for any reason*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming Assignments\n",
    "You will be given 6 programming assignments (PAs) to complete. All Python code written in assignments must adhere to the recommended [Python Style and Coding Standards](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gsprint23/cpts111/blob/master/PythonCodingStandardCptS111.ipynb); your TA will let you know if you are not adhering to these standards. \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to emphasize that **PAs should be completed independently**. It is easy to detect code sharing, don't do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please upload assignments as attached .zip files to the corresponding assignment in Blackboard. Recall the site is https://learn.wsu.edu/. Please refer to the [schedule](http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~gsprint/cpts111/schedule.html) for assignments and dates. All programming assignments must be submitted by midnight of the due date.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Labs\n",
    "You will be given 14 labs to complete. Each lab will give you hands-on experience with the Python programming language to solve multiple problems. These lab assignments also give you the opportunity to put into practice the techniques and concepts covered in the lessons with the help of your peers and a knowledgeable teaching assistant (TA). You are encouraged to share ideas with your peers in lab! Take advantage of learning from each other. You will receive full credit for a given lab if both:\n",
    "1. You show up and actively participate in the entire lab by making a sincere effort to complete all of the assigned problems.\n",
    "1. You make a sincere effort to assist other students with the lab in the event that you finish before them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, you are awarded credit in lab for participation and effort. You may make up some labs if you have an excuse that is acceptable as determined by the instructor. You are responsible for ensuring you receive appropriate credit from your TA for these special circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exams\n",
    "We will have two midterm exams and one final exam in this course. The final exam will be held on:\n",
    "* *Section 01*: Monday, May 1st; 8:00 – 10:00am\n",
    "* *Section 03*: Tuesday, May 2nd; 3:10 – 5:10pm\n",

    "Exams may be rescheduled for students that have valid excuses. To increase your chances of your excuse being determined \"valid\", notify the instructor no less than two days in advance if you are going to miss an exam\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: As per [university policy](https://registrar.wsu.edu/media/756534/spring-2017-final-exam.pdf), final exams may not be taken early. You must take your final exam at the time listed above for the course section you are enrolled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### zyBooks Textbook Activities\n",
    "You will be graded for completing participation and challenge activities in the zyBooks textbook. Completing at least 90% of the activities constitutes full credit for the assigned zyBooks chapters.

    "### Contesting a Grade\n",
    "If you believe that a mistake has been made with grading an assignment or exam, please *speak with the instructor or TA within one week of the assignment or exam being returned*. Do not wait until the end of the semester to discuss any grade changes. You need to constantly be aware of how you are performing in the class. Thus, there will not be any surprises at the end of the semester when grades are to be formally submitted. You should be able to view your grades via Blackboard. These will be updated weekly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the grades in Blackboard may just be raw scores and not be weighted according to the ones described here. Thus, be sure that you keep track of these weights so that you are not surprised by a change in your overall grade at the end of the semester."

    "1. You and a few friends are working together on an individual assignment. You just finished the assignment but have to head to class. One of your friends asks to meet up with you later for some help. You meet up with him/her after class and answer his/her questions with high-level descriptions on a white board (e.g. \"here is an example of how a for loop works\") and pictures (e.g. a drawing).\n",
    "    * Is this cheating? No, this kind of working together is encouraged.\n",
    "1. Your friend is almost done with his individual assignment but is stuck debugging. You take a look at his/her program and quickly realize that his/her loop is off by one. You explain how to fix the error to your friend.\n",
    "    * Is this cheating? No, this kind of working together is encouraged.\n",
    "1. On Piazza, a student has asked for code help on an individual assignment. You respond with a short code snippet.\n",
    "    * Is this cheating? No, this kind of working together is encouraged.\n",
    "1. You are stuck on an individual assignment, say coding a Hangman game, and turn to Google to help you out. You find code that completely implements the game of Hangman! You download the code, modify it to meet the assignment requirements, and turn it in.\n",
    "    * Is this cheating? YES! This is plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "If are unsure of whether a situation might be considered cheating, be cautious and don't do it. If help is required please ask the instructor or TA for guidance. We are always more than willing to help!!\n",

    "The fastest (and easiest) way to get better at programming is to program! This course moves fast and builds on itself. If you don't stay on top of the assignments, labs, and reading it will be difficult to catch up. You will do great in the course if you put the time in to learn the material on schedule and practice programming :)"
